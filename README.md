# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
An analysis on Kickstarter data was performed  to uncover trends and the following was discovered- 

*There are 525 successful theater campaigns in the united states 

*While there is only a total of 604 kickstarter campaigns for Plays in Great Britain, the Play category is the most successful

*The most successful kickstarter campaigns were started in May and December doesnt seem like a great time to launch a campaign

*Using the box and whisker plot, it was observed that the mean goal of 4000 pounds is outside the range of outlier for the amount pledged, so the recommedation is that Loiuse should get her play produced for less than 4000 pounds

*Its also worth noting that half of the campaign goals are less than 2000 pounds which is just over the 3rd quartile for the amount pledged

### Challenge
1. Given the provided data, we can draw the following conclusions:

* Few people are likely to support or back goals within the range of $45,000 to $49,999 under the Plays subcategory. This is becasue 100% failure was observed for goals within this range for the kickstarter campaign

* Although the highest percentage of successsful goals was 76% within the less than $1000 range in the plays subcategory, the number of projects within this range is less than the number of projects within the $1,000 to $4,999 range which had the second highest successful goal of 73%. Based on this ,a 73% goal success rate within the Play subcategory and $1,000 to $4,999 range is more realistic.

* A total of 493 failed kickstarter campaigns  within the theatre parent category was observed and 349 of those campaigns were in the United states.

2. The following are some limitations of this dataset 

* Unless further analysis is done, we are unable to determine the number of kickstarter campaigns that came close to the fund raising goals in a short amount of time

* More analysis is also required to determine whether the length of a campaign contributes to its ultimate success or failure

3. Suggestion of additional tables of graphs

* To determine whether the length of a campaign contributes to its success or failure and the number of campaigns that came close to its fund raising goals, two columns are required:  

   i. A column with formatted deadline date 
   
   ii. A column showing the difference between the deadline date and the launch date in days.
